Lulu employs the ESP32-S3 chip solution, powered by the XiaoZhi AI brain to build a multimodal real-time interaction system compatible with large models like Qwen and DeepSeek. Leveraging advanced semantic understanding and multilingual recognition technology, it delivers precise intelligent conversations, effortlessly handling diverse interactions like casual chats, information queries, and action execution. Its unique five-degree-of-freedom joint design—including a waist twisting joint paired with flexible leg joints—enables a series of coordinated, natural movements like greeting, cuddling, and seeking hugs, infusing interactions with fun and warmth. Additionally, Lulu integrates diverse components including microphones, speakers, cameras, and meteor lights. While ensuring stable movement, it delivers rich functionalities such as wake-word detection, multimodal interaction fusion, continuous intelligent learning, and customizable voiceprints, offering users an immersive smart desktop companion experience.
