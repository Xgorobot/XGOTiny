## Introduction

- This is an open-source ESP32 project by **Xia Ge**, released under the **MIT License**, allowing free personal and commercial use.  

-XGO-tiny (Lulu) is a miniature quadrupedal robot platform designed for educators, makers, and embedded AI enthusiasts. Powered by the ESP32-S3 single-chip microcontroller as its core controller, it deeply integrates the open-source AI voice framework “XiaoZhi,” achieving a fully localized closed-loop system spanning voice wake-up, natural language understanding, and action execution. Unlike other four-degree-of-freedom robotic dogs, XGO-tiny innovatively employs five bus-connected serial servos to form a five-degree-of-freedom (5DOF) motion structure. It introduces a waist servo in the robot's torso, communicating via UART bus. This significantly simplifies wiring complexity, resulting in a streamlined robot structure and enabling richer, more engaging movements.
