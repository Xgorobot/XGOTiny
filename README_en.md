## Introduction

- This is an open-source ESP32 project by **Xia Ge**, released under the **MIT License**, allowing free personal and commercial use.  

- **LULU** is built on the **ESP32-S3** platform and powered by the **Xiaozhi AI Engine**, enabling a multimodal real-time interactive system compatible with large models such as **Qwen** and **DeepSeek**.  

With advanced semantic understanding and multilingual recognition capabilities, LULU can engage in natural conversations, perform tasks, and handle information queries with ease.  

Its **five degrees of freedom design**, including a waist rotation joint and flexible leg mechanisms, allows lifelike movements such as waving, cuddling, and playful gestures ‚Äî creating a warm and engaging interaction experience.  

LULU integrates a **microphone, speaker, camera, and RGB meteor light**, supporting wake-word detection, multimodal fusion, continuous learning, and personalized voiceprint functions ‚Äî offering users an immersive smart desktop pet experience.  

**Luwu Dynamics** aims to help robotics enthusiasts learn and explore quadruped robot systems through this project.  

- If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to submit them via **Issues**.
